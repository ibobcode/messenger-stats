This project was inspired by the [Data Is Beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) Reddit community, and the [Counter For Messenger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/counter-for-messenger/ldlagicdigidgnhniajpmoddkoakdoca) chrome extension.
For now, it is still a **BETA!**, not all bugs have been found (please report any you encounter), and as it is an unofficial project made by reverse engineering the messenger API, it could be subject to unexpected crashes if Facebook came to change its API routes.
